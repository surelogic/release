    Installing the SureLogic Tools</h2>

    <p> It should take no more than 5 minutes for you to get up and
    running if you already have a working Eclipse installed on your
    machine. If you do not have Eclipse please go to the <a
    href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse Download Site</a>
    and download and install a copy. If you have any problems getting
    up and running, please call Tim Halloran at (412) 722-3338 for
    help. We want you to have a good experience with our product and
    are ready to help (it can sometimes be difficult to navigate the
    Eclipse plug-in installation and management user interface).</p>

    <p><a class="btn" href="./surelogic-tools-4-5-0-20130605.zip">Download
    Current Release</a></p>

    <p>The SureLogic tools contained in the Zip download above install
    as a feature in your Eclipse IDE. They are installed (and
    uninstalled) via the normal Eclipse mechanisms from an archived
    update site that you obtain from SureLogic. The following tools are
    available as Eclipse features:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><em>Flashlight Client</em></dt>
      <dd>Flashlight is a runtime profiler that illuminates threading behavior
      and access to shared state. </dd>

      <dt><em>Flashlight Client Android (Optional)</em></dt>
      <dd>Flashlight is a runtime profiler that illuminates threading behavior
      and access to shared state in Android applications. Your Eclipse must have
      the Android Development Tools (ADT) installed for this feature to install
      successfully. The normal <em>Flashlight Client</em> is also required for
      this feature to install successfully.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt><em>JSure Client</em></dt>
      <dd>JSure is a model-based static analysis tool that helps developers gain
      confidence in their multi-threaded code, regardless of scale or
      complexity.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt><em>Sierra Client</em></dt>
      <dd>Sierra is a bug management tool that helps developers deal with the
      often overwhelming number of findings produced by popular source code
      analysis tools when analyzing large codebases.</dd>
     
      <dt><em>Sierra Local Team Server (Optional)</em></dt>
      <dd>Install the Sierra Local Team Server feature if you want to
      try out the local team server, used in the tutorials. Installing
      this feature is recommended. The  normal <em>Sierra Client</em> is required for this
      feature to install successfully.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>The tools may be installed and used in versions 3.5.2, 3.6.2, 3.7.2, 4.2 (and
    higher) of Eclipse. Installing the tools on Linux is only supported for
    versions 3.6.2 of Eclipse and higher.  If you are not sure if your version
    of Eclipse is supported please contact SureLogic. The Eclipse-based IBM
    Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software (RAD) 8.0 is
    supported.</p>
    
    <p><strong><em>Before you begin:</em></strong> Make sure that your operating
    system user has read/write access to the Eclipse directory.  Plugin
    installation fails on some systems if Eclipse is unable to write to its
    installation directory.  We also recommend that you allow 1024 MB of heap
    space for your Eclipse JVM.  You can change this setting by modifying the
    <tt>-Xmx</tt> arguments in your
    <em>eclipse.ini</em> file located in your Eclipse installation directory. For example,
    under Eclipse 3.7 under Windows, you would change the last few lines of the <em>eclipse.ini</em> file from</p>
    
    <pre>-vmargs
-Xms40m
-Xmx384m</pre>

	<p>to</p>
	
	<pre>-vmargs
-Xms40m
-Xmx1024m</pre>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
	<p>
	  We find that installing the tools, especially for the first time, is
	  better done from an archived update site, which you can find <a
	  href="./surelogic-tools-4-5-0-20130605.zip">here</a>. This archive
	  contains the Sierra, JSure, and Flashlight features.  If you are an
	  advanced Eclipse user, you can also use our update site, located at <a
	  href="http://surelogic.com/static/eclipse">http://surelogic.com/static/eclipse</a>
	  and skip to step 3.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li>
	<p>Select 'Help | Install New Software&hellip;' to open the 'Install'
	    dialog.  Click the 'Add&hellip;' button in the upper-right of the
	    dialog.  In the dialog that opens select the
	    'Archive&hellip;' button and point the file selection dialog that
	    appears to the to the SureLogic archived update site file downloaded
	    in step 1, then press 'Open' followed by 'OK'.  The 'Install' dialog
	    should appear as shown in the figure below.</p>

	    <img src="./images/install-tools-in-eclipse.png" alt="Selecting features to install in Eclipse 3.5" />

	<p>Choose the features you want to install (or simply press 'Select All'), and press
	    'Next &gt;' and step through the remaining wizard dialog steps. The
	    features you are installing are not digitally signed, however, you
	    should allow them to be installed if you are warned by Eclipse that
	    it can't verify them. Finally, you should restart Eclipse when the
	    installation is completed.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>When Eclipse restarts you should see an item on the
      Eclipse main menu for each tool that you installed. The first
      thing you need to do is to install the license provided to you
      by SureLogic. To do this select the 'Manage SureLogic Licenses'
      menu choice from the Eclipse main menu from any of the tools
      (they all open a common dialog) as shown in the figure
      below.</p>

      <img src="./images/install-license-menu.png" alt="Main menu choice to install your license" />

      <p>In the dialog that appears, press the 'Install from File' if you saved your license in a file
      or 'Install from Clipboard' if you copied the text of your license from an email, respectively.</p>

      <img src="./images/install-license-dialog.png" alt="SureLogic license management dialog showing a license to use Flashlight has been installed" />

      <p>Once your license is loaded it may need to be activated. If so, highlight your license in the list of licenses and
      press 'Activate' to activate it. This step requires Internet access because the tool
      contacts SureLogic to verify your license is authentic.</p> 
      
      <p>See the 'Getting started' chapter of any of the tool User
      Guides for information on how you install your license and get
      up and running with the tool. The tool User Guides can by opened
      by selecting 'Help | Help Contents' from the Eclipse main
      menu</p>
      </li>

      <li>
	<p>To run the tutorials for Sierra, Flashlight, or JSure
	select the 'Run <em>Tool</em> Tutorials' menu choice from the
	Eclipse main menu for that tool. For example, For the
	JSure tool you would select 'JSure | Run JSure
	Tutorials' from the Eclipse main menu as shown in the figure
	below.</p>

	<img src="./images/install-tutorials-menu.png" alt="Main menu choice to install and run the JSure tutorials" />

	<p>This action will import the tutorial projects into your
	workspace and open the Eclipse help up to the beginning of the
	first tutorial. We recommend that you take the time to step
	through each tutorial.</p>

	<p>Also notice the 'Send Tip for Improvement' and 'Send
	Problem Report' menu items in the figure above. These menu
	items are your <em>direct link</em> to interact with the
	SureLogic engineers about your ideas to improve our tools and
	to report any problems you encounter.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>To learn more about how to use the tools select 'Help |
	Help Contents' and open the Sierra, Flashlight, or JSure User
	Guides. If you have installed JSure, you should also read the
	JSure Annotation Guide. These guides contain tutorial and
	reference information about how to use the tools
	effectively.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>You can stay current with the latest versions of all of the SureLogic
	tools by checking for updates from Eclipse. If you have not configured
	Eclipse to periodically check for updates, you can check for tool
	updates by selecting 'Help | Check For Updates'.  This will check
	the SureLogic update site
	at <a href="http://surelogic.com/static/eclipse">http://surelogic.com/static/eclipse</a>
	for any updates, regardless of whether you installed the tools from the
	archive site or from the remote site.</p>
