    <p> It should take no more than 5 minutes for you to get up and
    running if you already have a working Eclipse installed on your
    machine. If you do not have Eclipse please go to the <a
    href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse Download Site</a>
    and download and install a copy. If you have any problems getting
    up and running, please call Tim Halloran at (412) 722-3338 for
    help. We want you to have a good experience with our product and
    are ready to help (it can sometimes be difficult to navigate the
    Eclipse plug-in installation and management user interface).</p>

    <a class="btn" href="./surelogic-tools-3-2-0-20100511.zip">Download
    Current Release</a>

    <p>The SureLogic tools contained in the Zip downloaded above install
    as a feature in your Eclipse IDE. They are installed (and
    uninstalled) via the normal Eclipse mechanisms from an archived
    update site that you obtain from SureLogic. The following tools are
    available as Eclipse features:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><em>Flashlight Client</em></dt>
      <dd>Flashlight is a runtime profiler that illuminates threading behavior
      and access to shared state. </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt><em>JSure Client</em></dt>
      <dd>JSure is a model-based static analysis tool that helps developers gain
      confidence in their multi-threaded code, regardless of scale or
      complexity.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt><em>Sierra Client</em></dt>
      <dd>Sierra is a bug management tool that helps developers deal with the
      often overwhelming number of findings produced by popular source code
      analysis tools when analyzing large codebases.</dd>
      <dt><em>Sierra Client Java 5 Compatibility Libraries (Optional)</em></dt>
      <dd>The Java 5 compatibility libraries are <em>only</em>
      necessary if you are using a Java 5 JRE or JDK to run
      Sierra. This feature is not necessary if you are running Java 6
      or higher. We recommend you use Java 6 or higher and <em>do
      not</em> install this feature.</dd>
      <dt><em>Sierra Local Team Server (Optional)</em></dt>
      <dd>Install the Sierra Local Team Server feature if you want to
      try out the local team server, used in the tutorials. Installing
      this feature is recommended.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>The tools may be installed and used in versions 3.3 and higher of
    Eclipse. We do not recommend Eclipse 3.5 (due to a serious bug in
    this release that occurs when updates are unarchived for
    installation into Eclipse) and suggest you use 3.5.1 or above.
    <strong><em>Before you begin:</em></strong> We recommend that you
    have at least 512 MB of heap space and 128 MB of PermGen space on a
    32-bit JVM, and 768 MB of heap space and 256 MB of PermGen space on
    a 64-bit JVM.  You can change these settings my modifying the
    <tt>-Xmx</tt> and <tt>-XX:MaxPermSize</tt> arguments in your
    <em>eclipse.ini</em> file.</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
	<p>
	  We find that installing the tools, especially for the first time, is
	  better done from an archived update site, which you can find <a
	  href="./surelogic-tools-3-2-0-20100511.zip">here</a>. This archive
	  contains the Sierra, JSure, and Flashlight features.  If you are an
	  advanced Eclipse user, you can also use our update site, located at <a
	  href="http://surelogic.com/static/eclipse">http://surelogic.com/static/eclipse</a>
	  and skip to step 3.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li>
	<p>Follow one of the next three steps (and skip the others)
	based on what version of Eclipse you are using.</p>
	<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
	  <li>

	    Install New Software&hellip;' to open the 'Install'
	    dialog.  Click the 'Add&hellip;' button in the upper-right
	    of the dialog.  In the 'Add Site' dialog that opens select

	    <p>Choose the features you want to install (as shown
	    above), and press 'Next &gt;' and step through the
	    remaining wizard dialog steps. The features you are
	    installing are not digitally signed, however, you should
	    allow them to be installed if you are warned by Eclipse
	    that it can't verify them. Finally, you should restart
	    Eclipse when the installation is completed.</p>
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    <p><em>In Eclipse 3.4:</em> Select 'Help | Software
	    Updates&hellip;' to open the 'Software Updates and
	    Add-ons' dialog. Select the 'Available Software' tab and
	    click the 'Add Site&hellip;' button. In the 'Add Site'
	    dialog that opens select the 'Archive&hellip;' button and

	    below.</p>

	    <img src="./images/install-eclipse-34.png" alt="Selecting features to install in Eclipse 3.4" />

	    <p>Choose the features you want to install, then press
	    'Install&hellip;' (in the upper-right of the dialog
	    <em>not</em> 'Close" in the lower-right of the dialog) and
	    step through the remaining wizard dialog steps. The
	    features you are installing are not digitally signed,
	    however, you should allow them to be installed if you are
	    warned by Eclipse that it can't verify them. Finally, you
	    should restart Eclipse when the installation is
	    completed.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p><em>In Eclipse 3.3:</em> Select 'Help | Software
	    Updates | Find and Install&hellip;' to open the
	    'Install/Update' dialog. Select <em>Search for new
	    features to install</em> and press 'Next &gt;'. Press the
	    'New Archived Site&hellip;' and point the file selection
	    dialog that appears to the SureLogic archived update site
	    file downloaded in step 1 and press 'Open' and then
	    'OK'. Ensure the archive file is the only site checked and
	    press 'Finish'. The 'Updates' dialog should appear as
	    shown in the figure below.</p>

	    <img src="./images/install-eclipse-33.png" alt="Selecting Sierra features to install in Eclipse 3.3" />

	    <p>Choose the features you want to install (as shown
	    above), then press 'Next &gt;' and step through the
	    remaining wizard dialog steps. The features you are
	    installing are not digitally signed, however, you should
	    allow them to be installed if you are warned by Eclipse
	    that it can't verify them. Finally, you should restart
	    Eclipse when the installation is completed.</p>
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </li>

      <li><p>When Eclipse restarts you should see an item on the
      Eclipse main menu for each tool that you installed. The first
      thing you need to do is to install the license provided to you
      by SureLogic. To do this select the 'Manage SureLogic Licenses'
      menu choice from the Eclipse main menu from any of the tools
      (they all open a common dialog) as shown in the figure
      below.</p>

      <img src="./images/install-license-menu.png" alt="Main menu choice to install your license" />

      <p>In the dialog that appears, highlight the type of license you
      have, e.g., Flashlight, and press the 'Install License'
      button as shown in the figure below.</p>

      <img src="./images/install-license-dialog.png" alt="SureLogic license managment dialog showing a license to use Flashlight has been installed" />

      <p>See the 'Getting started' chapter of any of the tool User
      Guides for information on how you install your license and get
      up and running with the tool. The tool User Guides can by opened
      by selecting 'Help | Help Contents' from the Eclipse main
      menu</p>
      </li>

      <li>
	<p>To run the tutorials for Sierra, Flashlight, or JSure
	select the 'Run <em>Tool</em> Tutorials' menu choice from the
	Eclipse main menu for that tool. For example, For the
	Flashlight tool you would select 'Flashlight | Run Flashlight
	Tutorials' from the Eclipse main menu as shown in the figure
	below.</p>

	<img src="./images/install-tutorials-menu.png" alt="Main menu choice to install and run the Flashlight tutorials" />

	<p>This action will import the tutorial projects into your
	workspace and open the Eclipse help up to the beginning of the
	first tutorial. We recommend that you take the time to step
	through each tutorial.</p>

	<p>Also notice the 'Send Tip for Improvement' and 'Send
	Problem Report' menu items in the figure above. These menu
	items are your <em>direct link</em> to interact with the
	SureLogic engineers about your ideas to improve our tools and
	to report any problems you encounter.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>To learn more about how to use the tools select 'Help |
	Help Contents' and open the Sierra, Flashlight, or JSure User
	Guides. If you have installed JSure, you should also read the
	JSure Annotation Guide. These guides contain tutorial and
	reference information about how to use the tools
	effectively.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>You can stay current with the latest versions of all of the
	SureLogic tools by checking for updates from Eclipse. If you
	have not configured Eclipse to periodically check for updates,
	you can check for tool updates by selecting 'Help | Check For
	Updates' in Eclipse 3.5, 'Help | Software Updates&hellip;" in
	Eclipse 3.4, and 'Help | Software Updates | Find and
	Install&hellip;" in Eclipse 3.3.  This will check the
	SureLogic update site at <a
	href="http://surelogic.com/static/eclipse">http://surelogic.com/static/eclipse</a>
	for any updates, regardless of whether you installed the tools
	from the archive site or from the remote site.</p>
