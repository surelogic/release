    <h2 class="title">Downloading and Installing the Eclipse-based SureLogic Tools</h2>
    
    <p>The current SureLogic tool release is version [[VER]]. You must be running
    Eclipse on a Java 7 (or higher) VM (more details below).</p>
    
    <p>If you don't have a license you can get one <a href="/licensing.html">here</a>.
    You don't need a license to install the tools&mdash;just to use them.</p>
    
    <p> It should take no more than 5 minutes for you to get up and
    running if you already have a working Eclipse installed on your
    machine. If you do not have Eclipse please go to the <a
    href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse Download Site</a>
    and download and install a copy. If you have any problems getting
    our tools up and running, please email
    <a href="mailto:support@surelogic.com">support@surelogic.com</a> or
    file a report in our <a href="/bugzilla/index.cgi">Bugzilla</a>.
    We want you to have a good experience with our product and
    are ready to help. We realize that it can be difficult to navigate the
    Eclipse plug-in installation and management user interface.</p>

    <p><a class="btn" href="./[[ZIP]]">Click to download an archived update site
    for SureLogic tools version [[VER]] you can load into Eclipse</a></p>
    
    <p class="cen">or</p>
    
    <p><a class="btn">point your Eclipse at the SureLogic
    update site:</a></p>

    <p class="cencode">[[UPS]]</p>

    <p>The SureLogic tools contained in the Zip download are an
    archived Eclipse update site you can use to install
    the tools in your Eclipse IDE. The release is installed (and
    uninstalled) via the normal Eclipse mechanisms. Detailed
    instructions are given below.</p>
    
    <h3 class="title">The Eclipse-based SureLogic Tools</h3>
    
    <p>When you install the tools into your Eclipse you can choose which to
    install. This section describes each feature to help you decide what to
    install. The following tools are available as Eclipse features:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><em>Flashlight Client</em></dt>
      <dd>Flashlight is a dynamic analysis tools for Java focused on
      understanding, diagnosing, and correcting concurrency issues. It
      can be thought of as a "concurrency-focused profiler" as it also
      helps the developer to improve program responsiveness and performance. </dd>

      <dt><em>Flashlight Client Android (Optional)</em></dt>
      <dd>Flashlight is a runtime profiler that illuminates threading behavior
      and access to shared state in Android applications. Your Eclipse must have
      the Android Development Tools (ADT) installed for this feature to install
      successfully. The normal <em>Flashlight Client</em> is also required for
      this feature to install successfully.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt><em>JSure Client</em></dt>
      <dd>JSure is a model-based static analysis tool that helps developers gain
      confidence in their code, regardless of scale or complexity. JSure
      produces analysis-based verification results of consistency between
      programmer annotations (e.g., @ThreadSafe or @NonNull) and code.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt><em>Sierra Client</em></dt>
      <dd>Sierra is a bug management tool that helps developers deal with the
      often overwhelming number of findings produced by popular source code
      analysis tools (e.g., FindBugs and PMD) when analyzing large codebases.</dd>
     
      <dt><em>Sierra Local Team Server (Optional)</em></dt>
      <dd>Install the Sierra Local Team Server feature if you want to
      try out the local team server, used in the tutorials. Installing
      this feature is recommended. The  normal <em>Sierra Client</em> is required for this
      feature to install successfully.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h3 class="title">Getting Ready to Install</h3>

    <p>The tools may be installed and used in versions 3.7.2 and
    higher of Eclipse (higher being recommend).
    Eclipse 4.4 (or higher) is needed for Java 8 support.
    If you are not sure if your version of Eclipse is
    supported please contact SureLogic. The Eclipse-based IBM Rational
    Application Developer for WebSphere Software (RAD) 8.0 is supported.</p>

    <p><em>The current release of SureLogic Tools requires a Java 7 (or higher) VM
    be used to run the Eclipse that the tools are installed in.</em>
    Note: Eclipse will unfortunately allow the tools to be installed even if it
    is running in a Java 1.6 VM, but on restart the SureLogic Tools will not
    show up in the menu.  If you need more information on how to setup your Eclipse
    with multiple virtual machines, <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGZ1xTEqv0">this video</a> may prove
    useful.</p>
    
    <p><strong><em>Before you begin:</em></strong> Make sure that your operating
    system user has read/write access to the Eclipse directory.  Plugin
    installation fails on some systems if Eclipse is unable to write to its
    installation directory.  We also recommend that you allow roughly 1 GB of heap
    space for your Eclipse JVM.  You can change this setting by modifying the
    <tt>-Xmx</tt> arguments in your
    <em>eclipse.ini</em> file located in your Eclipse installation directory. For example,
    under Eclipse 3.7 under Windows, you would change the last few lines of
    the <em>eclipse.ini</em> file from</p>
    
    <pre>-vmargs
-Xms40m
-Xmx384m</pre>

	<p>to</p>
	
	<pre>-vmargs
-Xms40m
-Xmx1g</pre>

    <p>If you are <em>not</em> using a Java 8 VM you should also consider setting Perm Gen to 512 MB.
    To do this change <tt>--launcher.XXMaxPermSize</tt> in <em>eclipse.ini</em> (there might
    be two entries in the file) as as below</p>
    
        <pre>--launcher.XXMaxPermSize
512m</pre>

    <p>Most modern Eclipse releases set this to 265 MB which might be okay for most uses.
    The best solution is to use a Java 8 VM in which Oracle
    <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/122">removed Perm Gen</a>&mdash;so you
    don't have to worry about it.</p>
    
    <h3 class="title">Step By Step Installation </h3>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
	  <p>Select 'Help | Install New Software&hellip;' on the Eclipse main menu to open the 'Install'
	  dialog.</p>
	  <img src="./images/eclipse-menu.png" alt="Menu item to open the Install dialog in Eclipse" />
	  <img src="./images/install-dialog.png" alt="Install dialog in Eclipse" />
	  <p>At this point you have the option of installing using the archived update site or
	  installing using the SureLogic web-based update site directly.</p> 
	  
	  <ol>
	    <li>To install using the downloaded <a href="./[[ZIP]]">archived update site</a> file,
	    click the 'Add&hellip;' button in the upper-right of the
	    dialog.  In the dialog that opens select the
	    'Archive&hellip;' button and point the file selection dialog that
	    appears to the to the archived update site file you downloaded.
	    Press 'Open' to choose the file, followed by 'OK' to return to the
	    'Install' dialog.</li>
	    <li>To install using the SureLogic update site, click the 'Add&hellip;'
	    button in the upper-right of the dialog. Copy and paste the URL <tt>[[UPS]]</tt>
	    into the 'Location:' text box. Press 'OK' to return to the 'Install' dialog.</li>
	  </ol>
	  </li>
	  
	  <li>
	  <p>At this point, regardless of which installation method you choose, the dialog
	  should list the SureLogic tool features as shown below.</p>

	  <img src="./images/install-tools-in-eclipse.png" alt="Selecting features to install in Eclipse" />

	  <p>Choose the features you want to install (or simply press 'Select All'), and press
	  'Next &gt;' and step through the remaining wizard dialog steps. The
	  features you are installing are not digitally signed, however, you
	  should allow them to be installed if you are warned by Eclipse that
	  it can't verify them. Finally, you should restart Eclipse when the
	  installation is completed.</p>
	    
	  <p><i>Do not check</i> 'Flashlight Client Android (Optional)' <i>if you do not have the
	  Android Development Tools (ADT) installed in your Eclipse.</i>. Please uncheck this optional
	  feature as shown in the figure below.</p>
	    
	  <img src="./images/install-tools-no-android.png" alt="Don't select the Flashlight Client Android feature if you don't have the Android SDK" />
      </li>

      <li><p>When Eclipse restarts you should see an item on the
      Eclipse main menu for each tool that you installed. The first
      thing you need to do is to install the license provided to you
      by SureLogic. To do this select the 'Manage SureLogic Licenses'
      menu choice from bottom choice of the Eclipse main menu of any
      of the SureLogic tools (they all open the same dialog). The
      menu choice in the JSure Eclipse menu is shown in the figure below.</p>

      <img src="./images/install-license-menu.png" alt="Main menu choice to install your license" />

      <p>In the dialog that appears, press the 'Install from File' if you saved your license to a file
      or 'Install from Clipboard' if you copied the text of your license from an email, respectively.
      If you don't have a license you can get one <a href="/licensing.html">here</a>.</p>

      <img src="./images/install-license-dialog.png" alt="SureLogic license management dialog showing a license has been installed" />

      <p>Once your license is loaded it may need to be activated. If so,
      highlight your license in the list of licenses and
      press 'Activate' to activate it. This step requires Internet access because the tool
      contacts SureLogic to verify your license is authentic. Your activated
      license may need to be renewed every now and then, e.g., every six months.
      To do this highlight the license and press 'Renew' to renew it. As with activation
      this step requires Internet access because the tool contacts SureLogic to verify
      your license is authentic.</p> 
      
      <p>See the 'Getting started' chapter of any of the tool User
      Guides for information on how you install your license and get
      up and running with the tool. The tool User Guides can by opened
      by selecting 'Help | Help Contents' from the Eclipse main
      menu. Alternatively you can choose the 'Save Documentation As...' menu
      item from any of the SureLogic tools to save an HTML version of
      the documentation to your disk and use your favorite browser
      to read the tool documentation.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
	  <p>To run the tutorials for Sierra, Flashlight, or JSure
	  select the 'Install Tutorial Projects' menu choice from the
	  Eclipse main menu for that tool. For example, For the
	  JSure tool you would select 'JSure | Install Tutorial Projects'
	  from the Eclipse main menu as shown in the figure below.</p>

	  <img src="./images/install-tutorials-menu.png" alt="Main menu choice to install the JSure tutorials" />

	  <p>This action will import the tutorial projects into your
	  workspace and open the Eclipse help up to the beginning of the
	  first tutorial. We recommend that you take the time to step
	  through each tutorial.</p>

	  <p>Also notice the 'Send Tip for Improvement' and 'Send
	  Problem Report' menu items in the figure above. These menu
	  items are your <em>direct link</em> to interact with the
	  SureLogic engineers about your ideas to improve our tools and
	  to report any problems you encounter. JSure (as shown above)
	  allows you to send annotations you have changed on libraries
	  to SureLogic for consideration in future releases via
	  the 'Send Library Annotation Changes' menu item.</p>
      </li>
 
      <li>
      <p>To learn more about how to use the tools select 'Help |
      Help Contents' and open the Sierra, Flashlight, or JSure User
      Guides. These guides contain tutorial and
      reference information about how to use the tools
      effectively. You may also use the 'Save Documentation As...'
      menu item to save a copy of the documentation to your disk
      in HTML format which can be loaded into any browser.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <p>You can stay current with the latest versions of all of the SureLogic
      tools by checking for updates from Eclipse. If you have not configured
      Eclipse to periodically check for updates, you can check for tool
      updates by selecting 'Help | Check For Updates'.  This will check
      the SureLogic update site at <tt>[[UPS]]</tt> for any updates, regardless
      of whether you installed the tools from the	archive site or from the remote site.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
